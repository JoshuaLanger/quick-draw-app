# Quick Draw!
Shoot the gunman before he shoots you!

The rules:
1. Click the box to shoot
2. Only click when it's 'ready', otherwise you lose
3. Once it's 'ready', you have a limited time to shoot
4. If you shoot in that time, your score increments, and you go on to the next round
5. If you don't, you lose
